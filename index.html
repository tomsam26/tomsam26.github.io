                <h2>LOGIC GATE</h2>
                <p>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical
                    operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.</p>

                <h2>ASCII</h2>
                <p>stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers,
                    so
                    it is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.</p>

                <h2>RANDOM-ACCESS MEMORY <em>(RAM)</em></h2>
                <p>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase
                    the
                    general speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost
                    the same
                    amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</p>

                <h2>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</h2>
                <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of
                    output.
                    They generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that
                    implement
                    specific algorithms.</p>

                <h2>DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM <em>(DNS)</em></h2>
                <p>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to
                    the
